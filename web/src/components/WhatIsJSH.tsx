        This is a shell that has the speed and good looks of Ghosty or Kitty but with new advanced integrated features. The originals, such as PowerShell, Windows Command Line, and Linux Command Line are very good. However, they all lack modern features
        since they were designed for old computers. Jewl Shell is built to change that and bring the features that were missing all along. Normally this would require libraries or additional packages, but in Jewl Shell you can just enable and disable
        these advanced features.
