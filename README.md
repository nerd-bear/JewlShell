# Squishy Shell (SQS)

Welcome to the advanced integrated development shell named Squishy Shell, also known as SQS. The originals, such as but not limited to PowerShell, Windows Command Line, and the Linux Command Line, are very good. However, all of them lack modern features because they were designed for old computers.

But SQS brings many new features and is designed for modern standards and computers. Some of these features are:

HTTPS requests, Built-in SSH, Built-in text editors, Shortcuts, Custom GUI support, Custom embedded languages (and the compiler), Package management API, Directory management, Built-in AI Chat bot (OpenAI integration), Team sharing, Custom rsync version, Support for CLI Python 3.12 interpretation, Password brute force API, Binary hex file editor, Intermediate level CLI game-engine API, Built-in LLVM and IR support and even more!
