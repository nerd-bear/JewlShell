# Jewel Shell

This is an Open Source project called Jewel Shell. The goal is to create a Shell that has the speed and good looks of Ghosty or Kitty but with new advanced integrated features. The originals, such as PowerShell, Windows Command Line, and Linux Command Line, are very good. However, they all lack modern features because they were designed for old computers. Jewel Shell is built to change that and bring the features that were missing all along. Normally these features require libraries or additional software.

## Key Features

* HTTPS requests
* Built-in SSH
* Built-in text editors
* Shortcuts, Custom GUI support
* Custom embedded languages (and the compiler)

* Support for CLI Python 3.12 interpretation
* Password brute force API
* Binary hex file editor
* Intermediate-level CLI game-engine API
* Built-in LLVM/IR support
* and even more
